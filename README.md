# New Zealand Department of Conservation (DoC) Wilderness Huts
The New Zealand Department of Conservation manages over 950 huts throughout the country.
 
Huts provide unique places to stay, refuge from bad weather and a place to rest and recover
when you are out exploring the many parks and reserves.
 
Some date from the late 1800s, but the majority were built during the 1960s and 1970s for deer
culling. Since the late 1970s, new huts have been purpose-built for recreation.
